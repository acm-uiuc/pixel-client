                In python, you do not need to declare variables before using them, or declare their type.
        </p>
        <p>
                Python supports two types of numbers: integers and floating point numbers.
                To see the difference between the declaration of the two, check the provided starter code.
        </p>
        <p>
                Strings can be declared by using either single quotes('') or double quotes("").
                However, Using double quotes is helpful while dealing with strings containing apostrophes.
