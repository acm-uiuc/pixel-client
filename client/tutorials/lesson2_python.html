    Welcome to the 2nd lesson for Python!
</h1>
<p>
    In python, you do not need to declare variables before using them, or declare their type.
</p>
<p>
    Python supports two types of numbers: integers and floating point numbers.
    To see the difference between the declaration of the two, check the provided starter code.
</p>
<p>
    Strings can be declared by using either single quotes('') or double quotes("").
    However, Using double quotes is helpful while dealing with strings containing apostrophes.
