        Welcome to the 3rd lesson for Python!
</h1>
<p>
        This tutorial deals with basic operations on integers, floating point values, and strings.
</p>
<p>
        All basic arithmetic operations(+ , - , *, /) can be performed on integers and floating point values.
        We can also perform other operations such as the remainder operator(%) on these types.
        As an exercise, use basic operators and dsiplay the result.
</p>
<p>
        If we perform operations between integers and floating point values, the result is automatically
        converted to a float.
        This is known as implicit type conversion.
</p>
<p>
        Type conversion can also be done by stating the new type in parentheses.
        This is called explicit type conversion.
        For an example, look at the provided starter code.
</p>
<p>
        Multiple strings can be appended using the '+' operator.
        As an exercise, store your name in a string variable titled 'name' and display "My name is 'your name'".

        Multiple strings can be appended using the '+' operator.
        As an exercise, store your name in a string variable titled 'name' and display "My name is 'your name'".
</p>
<p>
        We can display multiple outputs on the same line by separating them with a comma inside the parentheses
        of a print statement.
        Try using this to display different types of data using a single print statement.
