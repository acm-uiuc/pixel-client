    Welcome to the 4th lesson for Python!
</h1>
<p>
    In this lesson, we'll learn about loops, a powerful concept for executing a task multiple times.
</p>
<p>
    Python has two types of loops: the for loop and the while loop.
</p>
<p>
    The range function: In python range(endPoint) helps you access whole numbers from 0 to endPoint - 1.
    So, range(5) helps you traverse from 0 to 1, 2, 3, and 4. The range function is useful in for loops.
</p>
<p>
    The syntax for a for loop is:
    for *some condition* :
    *perform a task*
    (Notice the indentation)
    Check the starter code for an example.
</p>
<p>
    The syntax for a while loop is:
    for *some condition holds true* :
    *perform a task*
    (Notice the indentation)
    Check the starter code for an example.
</p>
<p>
    Break statement: A break statement can be used to "break" out of a loop for some condition.
    Check the starter code for an example.
</p>
<p>
    Continue statement: A continue statement can be used to not perform the task for some condition.
    Check the starter code for an example.
</p>

    (Hint: think of how loops can be used to speed up the process of changing a pixel using the client)
