            Welcome to the 1st lesson for Python!
        </h1>
        <p>
                The simplest directive in Python is the "print" directive - it simply prints out a line and also includes a newline.
                As the print statement is a function, it must be invoked using parentheses.
                The syntax is :
                print("text")
                The above code simply prints "text"
                As an exercise, use the given starter code to print "Hello, world!"
